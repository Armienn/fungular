Playing with Angular and Node

## Setup

- Install Node.js
- Install Node tools for Visual Studio
- Clone the project and open it in Visual Studio

In visual studio:
- Open the Node.js interactive window and type ".npm install -g typings"
- Afterwards ".npm install"
- And finally ".npm start"

The last command will start the webserver and some typescript file watching stuff, so typescript files are compiled when they're saved.
The process can't be stopped through the interactive window in Visual Studio, only through the task manager, which sucks.

As an alternative, open up a console window and navigate to the directory, and then start the project by writing "npm start".

Another alternate is to just start the project via the Visual Studio run button thingie, but then the watching service doesn't run.
